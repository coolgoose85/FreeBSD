1) SMP/Locking

	The code makes use of ng_send_fn() whenever possible. Just
	need to verify and make sure i did it right

2) Firmware upgrade

	According to Bluetooth spec device may present third interface
	to perform firmware upgrade. 3Com USB Bluetooth dongle has
	such interface. Need to implement set of Netgraph messages.

3) Isochronous USB transfers (SCO data)

	Tried to fix isochrounous transfers, which are still disabled
	by default.
